# piglass
raspberry pi zero w + vufine + other things coming soon

The zoom is set to a point in which the video feed lines up with your field of view
The user interface will be done with opencv
The way the user communicates with piglass is a bluetooth keyboard
I may replace it with one of [these](https://learn.adafruit.com/make-a-google-glass-remote-with-bluefruit/overview)

Controls:
Z: zoom in 
X: zoom out
C: zoom in all the way/zoom out all the way
N: zoom to inital setting
P: take picture
V: take video
T: toggle text on/off


not a pi w pictured but you get the idea...
